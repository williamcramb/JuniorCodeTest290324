# Junior Developer Code Test

Using the base code provided within this repository, make changes to satisfy the following requirements.

You can refactor any elements you wish so long as the requirements are fulfilled
If you want to add any additional functionality to showcase skills, feel free to do so, but this is not a requirement.

## Requirements

1. Use the [RandomUser API](https://randomuser.me/api) to output the following details for the first 5 “random users” that the API calls return:

   - Title
   - First Name
   - Surname
   - Age
   - Country
   - Latitude
   - Longitude

2. Add a 'refresh' button that updates the list of random users

Documentation for the API can be found [here](https://randomuser.me/documentation)

Please do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have.
